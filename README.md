# Khoroch
## Intro
A family expense tracking web app where members can join a shared group, log their spending, and view each other's expenses transparently — month by month.

## Description
Khoroch (খরচ) is a full-stack web application built for families who want to track their collective monthly expenses. After signing up, a user can create a family group or join one using a shared code.
